            <h2> What is JavaScript? </h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) 
                programming language with first-class functions. While it is most
                well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser 
                environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.
                JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded,
                dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative,
                and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.
                JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS and
                can calculate, manipulate and validate data.

            <h2>What is Go (Golang)?</h2>
            <p>
                Go (Golang) is a programming language used for a variety of purposes,
                including servers, web development, cloud infrastructure, and command-line
                interfaces. Itâ€™s also beginner-friendly and easy to remember.
                Go was designed by Google in 2007. Google was rapidly growing then,
                and the code its engineers were using, C++ was difficult to manage
                and overly complex. This slowed down the development process.
                So Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson,
                developed something easier to manage and learn. This language was Go.

            <p>
                In the ever-evolving world of programming, Rust has emerged 
                as a significant player. Known for its focus on safety and 
                performance, Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language 
                that has been gaining traction among developers.
                But what exactly is Rust, and why is it gaining such
                popularity? tâ€™s designed to be a systems programming language, 
                competing with C and C++ in areas like operating systems, game engines,
                and other high-performance applications. Rust is a systems programming
                language that has gained significant popularity among developers.

            <h2>What is React library for JavaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                React is a framework that employs Webpack to automatically compile React,
                JSX, and ES6 code while handling CSS file prefixes. React is a JavaScript-based
                UI development library. Although React is a library rather than a language,
                it is widely used in web development. The library first appeared in May 2013
                and is now one of the most commonly used frontend libraries for web development.
                React offers various extensions for entire application architectural support,
                such as Flux and React Native, beyond mere UI.

            <h2>What is Next.JS Framework?</h2>
            <p>
                Next.js is a popular React framework that enables developers to
                build feature-rich, scalable web applications. It provides a
                powerful combination of server-side rendering (SSR) and static
                site generation (SSG) capabilities, making it an excellent
                choice for creating dynamic, high-performance websites.
                In this article, we will explore the benefits of Next.js
                and how it can enhance your web development experience.
                It is developed by Vercel and Next.js stands out for its capabilities.

            <h2>What is Astro Framework?</h2>
            <p>
                Astro is a modern web framework designed to help you build
                fast and efficient websites with a focus on content. It stands
                out for its use of Island Architecture, allowing parts of your
                website to be dynamic only when needed. Astro is framework agnostic,
                meaning it lets you use tools like React, Vue, or Svelte seamlessly.
                One of its key features is the Zero JavaScript approach for faster
                page loads. Whether you're just starting or looking to switch to a
                more performance-oriented framework.
